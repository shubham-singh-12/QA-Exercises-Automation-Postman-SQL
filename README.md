# Selenium Automation Script for KloudShip Application

This Python script automates the process of adding a new package to the KloudShip application using Selenium WebDriver and the Chrome browser.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed (version 3.6 or later)
- Google Chrome browser installed
- Chrome WebDriver installed and added to the system PATH

You can download the Chrome WebDriver from the official website: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```
pip install selenium
```

## Usage

1. Open the `Test case 1 - Automation.py` file in a text editor or Python IDE.
2. Ensure that the application URL (`https://ecs-qa.kloudship.com`) and login credentials are correct.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```
python "Test case 1 - Automation.py"
```

The script will perform the following actions:

1. Launch the Google Chrome browser.
2. Navigate to the KloudShip application URL.
3. Log in to the application using the provided credentials.
4. Navigate to the "Package Types" page.
5. Click the "Add Manually" button.
6. Enter the package details:
   - Name: "Shubham Singh"
   - Length: Random integer between 1 and 9
   - Width: Random integer between 1 and 9
   - Height: Random integer between 1 and 9
7. Submit the form by clicking the check button and then the more_vert button.
8. Verify that the package is added successfully (verification logic can be added to the script).
9. Log out of the application.
10. Close the browser instance.

## Notes

- The script uses the Selenium WebDriver library to automate the browser interactions.
- It utilizes explicit wait conditions to handle potential synchronization issues and wait for elements to be present and clickable.
- The locators used in the script are based on the application's DOM structure at the time of writing. If the application's UI changes, the locators may need to be updated accordingly.
- The script generates random integer values for the package dimensions (length, width, and height) between 1 and 9.
- After the package is added, the verification logic can be implemented in the commented section of the script.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the script, ensure that:

- Google Chrome and the Chrome WebDriver are installed correctly.
- The Chrome WebDriver is added to the system PATH.
- The application URL and login credentials are correct.
- The locators used in the script match the application's DOM structure.

If the issue persists, you can try increasing the timeout values or adjusting the locators based on the application's behavior.

Feel free to modify the script or add additional functionality as per your requirements.
